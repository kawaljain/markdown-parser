## üîÆ Future Work

While the current version of **Markdown Parser** supports the basic markdown syntax, there are several improvements and features that can be added in future versions:

1. **Extended Markdown Support:**

   - Add support for additional markdown syntax like tables, blockquotes, task lists, and footnotes.
   - Enhance support for nested lists and complex inline elements.

2. **Performance Optimization:**

   - Implement a more efficient parsing algorithm to handle larger markdown files with improved speed and memory usage.
   - Optimize the parser for streaming large files, reducing memory footprint for large documents.

3. **Customizable Output:**

   - Add an option to output custom HTML structures or other formats like PDF or LaTeX.
   - Support for HTML/CSS styling options for better control over the output's appearance.

4. **Syntax Highlighting:**

   - Improve code block rendering with support for multiple languages and better syntax highlighting.

5. **Error Handling and Debugging:**

   - Add better error messages for malformed markdown to help developers debug their documents more easily.
   - Provide a debugging mode to trace the parsing process step by step.

6. **Markdown Extensions:**

   - Support for custom markdown extensions, allowing users to define their own syntax or semantic rules.
   - Consider supporting popular extensions like MathJax for rendering mathematical equations in markdown.

7. **Interactive Features:**
   - Develop an interactive web interface for live markdown-to-HTML conversion.
   - Include real-time previews and markdown editors that leverage the parser.

If you have ideas or suggestions for features you‚Äôd like to see in future releases, feel free to contribute or open an issue on the repository. We‚Äôre excited to see how this project evolves with the help of the community!
